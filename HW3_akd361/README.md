Assignment 1
Jonathan and Fernando answered some simple questions that helped me get set up with the right modules.
Worked side-by-side with Chris Streich on Assignment 1.
Hrakfnell answered some conceptual questions about what we were working on such as how the dictionary gets overwrited.
He suggested using a float instead of an integer.
Enrique Sanz Gonzalez helped figure out how to plot multiple distributions on a single histogram. Turned out it was simply naming the
distributions and listing them in pl.hist().

Assignment 2

Maisha Lopa (mal824) showed me how to bring the Citi Bike data into JupyterHub after downloading it onto my machine.
I did the scatter plot of age and trip duration quickly on my own.
I then had Pooneh join my team and helped her import the data from the url (which Maisha had shown me). She wondered if we should be using a discrete (or categorical) variable on the x axis. We left it for now.

Assignment 3

I figured this one out mostly on my own (I understand the stats conceptually) with a little help talking through it with Maisha. Worked side by side with Francis Ko.
