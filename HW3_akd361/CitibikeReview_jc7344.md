Given the fact that the question was aiming to stablish a relationship between trip duration and Citi Bike users’ age, both Alternative and Null hypotheses had to include a hint of a correlation test within their texts.Alternative hypothesis stated a negative correlation between age of CitBike users’ and their trip durations. This correlation had to be statistically significant, therefore a 0.05 confident level was set to test its existence. Null hypothesis, on the other hand, was carefully chosen and it consisted on three different attributes. Firstly, the negative correlation between age and trip duration had to be below 0.05 confident interval. Additionally, Null hypothesis also included the possibility of a non-apparent correlation between the two variables. Lastly, and in order to cover all cases in which the alternative Hypothesis would not happen, the nature of the correlation would have to be positive instead of negative. After stating both hypothesis, the given data was well utilized. By choosing year of birth as the independent variable and trip duration as the dependent, it was possible to process only needed information. Year of birth is a special type of variable as it is composed by “year” which could be described as continuous, however, in this case each year is considered as a whole discrete unit. Trip duration, on the other hand, is a clear example of a continuous variable as it includes any variable within a range. Given the nature of both variables, a correlation test could be employed for identifying how strong, and in what direction are the independent variable, year of birth, and dependent variable, trip duration, related.
