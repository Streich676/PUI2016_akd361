Assignments 1 & 2

Worked on assignments 1 and 2 in a group with John (forget his last name - non CUSP student) and Bailey.
John helped answer a lot of the technical questions. Bailey had some tips on syntax and techniques.

I gave some tips to the group of Wagner students, to Pooneh Famili, to Rich Vecsler, and to Avikal.

Assignment 3 I did on my own, see markdown file.
