Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

EXPERIMENT 1

Do diets help people lose more fat than exercise does?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Three test groups: those making no change to their behavior (S_0), those increasing exercise(S_E), and those improving diet (S_D).

Average weight loss in each group = loss_0, loss_E, and loss_D.

S_0 control group is used to control for seasonal or other normal changes in people's weight.

First observation should be whether loss_E and loss_D are greater than loss_0. Assuming they are, compare loss_E with loss_D.

Null hypothesis: the average weight lost by those on a diet was the same or less than the average weight lost by those exercising.

H_0: loss_D <= loss_E

EXPERIMENT 2

Do Americans trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

Null hypothesis: 50% or less of poll respondents said the trust the president.

N_Y = percentage of respondents who said yes, they trust the president
N_N = percentage of respondents who said no, they do not trust the president

H_0: N_Y <= 50

EXPERIMENT 3

Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

Null hypothesis: the number of 

EXPERIMENT 4

Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.
