Worked with Pooneh and Anastasia on assignment 1. I forked Pooneh's readme file, which I later realized was a mistake.

Anastasia forked my repo gittest_akd361, edited the file hianastasia.txt, and I approved her edit.

I later changed the name of the repo - via GitHub.com - from gittest_adrian to gittest_akd361.
I think this screwed up the fork that Pooneh was attempting.

Then I forked Pooneh's repo gittest_pf910 and edited her file myfirstfile.txt.
We didn't quite connect there and finished task when I forked and she approved my edit of myfirstfile.txt in another repo, gittest_pf210-1.

Danny and Henry gave me some tips with finishing assignment one.

Danny helped me create the alias for assigment two.
I had reached a snag when I didn't put a period before "bashrc".

I did steps 6-8 on my own.

Step 8 says to upload "screenshots" but I only caught one request for a screenshot, showing the output of the alias.
