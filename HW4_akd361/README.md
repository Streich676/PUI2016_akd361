Assignment 2

Worked with Victor (vsg247) and Rich (rav220). This assignment was pretty straightforward once we found a study that used a chi square test and had easily readible results. We did debate one thing: whether the dependent variable was categorical or continuous. It's expressed in Figure 4 as a percentage (of horses studied who had aggressive behavior), which seems continuous, but ultimately we agreed that they really were measuring a binary variable: either the horse displayed aggressive behavior or they didn't (aggressive incidents > 0).

chi-square	| 1, vertebral pain; two categories: 0-1 affected vertebrae vs 2+ affected vertebrae | categorical | 1, proportion of horses that have at least one aggressive incident | categorical/binary (% looks like a continuous variable, but it's simply measuring two categories: horses with no aggressive incidents vs horses with at least one aggressive incident) | N/A | N/A | 	Are horses with at least two damaged vertebrae more likely to have aggressive incidents? | Horses with at least two damaged vertebrae are equally or less likely to be aggressive than those without (based on proportions of the sample). | 0.05 | [Partners with Bad Temper: Reject or Cure?

multiple regression	| 17 "exploratory" variables in four groups: socioeconomic, health, enviroment, political/social; corruption was the variable of greatest interest, while the others were "adjustment variables" | mostly continuous; corruption is categorical (0-10), some others may be categorical | 1: under 5 child mortality per 1000 live births | continuous | there isn't a control exactly, but the adjustment variables show the importance of the corruption problem relative to other factors that affect childhood mortality | N/A | Does higher corruption increase a country's childhood mortality? | Countries with higher Corruption Perception Index have equivalent or fewer deaths of children under 5 per 1000 live births compared with countries with lower CPI. | .05 for the first step, .01 for the second step | [Corruption Kills: Estimating the Global Impact of Corruption on Children Deaths](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026990) |

** Because of scheduling I had to do assignments 3 and 4 on my own, and I couldn't quite get 100% of the way there without help. **
