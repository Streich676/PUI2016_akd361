Assignment 1

Assignment 2

Worked with Victor (vsg247) and Rich (rav220). This assignment was pretty straightforward once we found a study that used a chi square test and had easily readible results. We did debate one thing: whether the dependent variable was categorical or continuous. It's expressed in Figure 4 as a percentage (of horses studied who had aggressive behavior), which seems continuous, but ultimately we agreed that they really were measuring a binary variable: either the horse displayed aggressive behavior or they didn't (aggressive incidents > 0).
