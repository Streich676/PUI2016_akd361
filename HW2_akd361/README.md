Jonathan Pichot helped me with assignment 1. He recommended Atom as a text editor and Postman to view the bus data.
So the file was stored locally.

I followed Federica's lead on the modules needed. Might have imported more than needed.

The script inputs the API key and the bus line by editing the URL as shown by Federica's example.

Jonathan explained how to use the following syntax to pick a location within the data:
data["Siri"]["ServiceDelivery"]["VehicleMonitoringDelivery"][0]["VehicleActivity"]

As recommended by Jonathan, I used a for loop to extract data for each bus at the "MonitoredVehicleJourney" level.

Used an iterator to give the bus a number label.

I needed help on this one so I didn't help anyone else.

Ben Miller answered a quick question too.
